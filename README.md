# PRJ666 - Visions

#### Project Description:

* Currently a lot of small/corner stores manage all the resources (product inventory, transaction history, employee's salary, etc.) using paper, this is highly inefficient.
* Our team is aiming to solve the store's problem by developing a store management system with different interfaces with limited access for the clerks and increased access for management.
* This store management system will include inventory, transaction records, contacts, and product orders.
* This system will be scalable, easy to install and set up.

#### The Business Opportunity

* We will be developing a management system to improve store infrastructure. This is because alot of small/corner stores is utilizes mostly paper-based methods of management.
